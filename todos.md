# Todos

-   [ ] Look up additional projects which may already provide code snippet / node managers to get ideas
    -   [ ] [pieces.app](https://pieces.app/)
    -   [ ] [pieces.app cli](https://code.pieces.app/updates/new-pieces-cli-for-macos)
-   [ ] Research how to deploy / install a cli tool so that it can be used globally from the command line
-   [ ] Research languages to use for CLI tool (Go or Python?)
-   [ ] Research how to enter multi-line strings and save them
-   [ ] Research a database to use (SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB?)
-   [ ] If using SQL, research how you could add multiple tags to an item but still be able to quickly search against multiple tags. (probably use a separate tags table which links via a one to many relationship to the notes table)
-   [ ] Start by writing to a file (.txt?) and then update to SQL?
-   [ ] Start simple, create a simple todo-like app by just giving capabilities for adding, viewing, updating and deleting lines from a text file.
-   [ ] Determine format of single-line and multi-line notes (ex. will notes have titles? will this be optional?)
-   [ ] Determine how will manage tags and notes (if a note is deleted, is the corresponding tag deleted?). Maybe there is a command which cleans up tags if they aren't being used by any notes?

## Ideas

-   [ ] Would it be easier if the cli tool would open up vim to take a note and then save it to a database?
